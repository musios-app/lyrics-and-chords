# Lyrics & Chords skill

Slug: `lyrics-and-chords`. Licence: GPL-2.0-only (see `LICENSE`).

A skill that loads song lyric and chord files (plain lyrics, chords above words, inline chords, ChordPro, Word files, pasted text), repairs what the readers get wrong, checks that no word or chord was lost, and returns a JSON object: the song with its facts and sections, plus anything it could not resolve. It runs entirely locally and makes no network requests. It is built on ChordSheetJS.

Status: version 0.1, provisional. `SKILL.md` defines the capabilities; the scripts for loading, checking and writing out songs are built. Design notes: [docs/design-notes.md](docs/design-notes.md).

## Build and install

```
npm install            # once: fetches ChordSheetJS and the bundler
npm test               # the tests (invented lyrics only)
python3 build.py       # builds dist/lyrics-and-chords.skill
```

The build checks `SKILL.md` against the Agent Skills rules, bundles ChordSheetJS into one file so the skill needs no `npm install`, copies the scripts, writes `NOTICE.txt`, zips the folder, and then runs the packaged scripts from a folder outside this repo as a test. `dist/` is generated: never edit it by hand.

The package needs only Node.js 18 or later. To install it:
- **Claude Code:** unzip `dist/lyrics-and-chords.skill` into `~/.claude/skills/`, so that `~/.claude/skills/lyrics-and-chords/SKILL.md` exists.
- **claude.ai:** upload the `.skill` file in Customize > Skills.

The GPL asks that anyone who receives the package can get the source. Until this repository is public, share the `.skill` file only with people you also give the repository to.

- Version installed here: 18.0.0, licence GPL-2.0-only, no runtime dependencies.

ChordSheetJS describes itself as "a JavaScript library for parsing and formatting chord sheets".

### Key functions

- Parse a chord sheet into a `Song` object (`ChordProParser`, `ChordsOverWordsParser`, `UltimateGuitarParser`).
- Format a `Song` back out as text, HTML (table or div layout), ChordPro or chords over words.
- Read ChordPro directives into `Song.metadata` (title, artist, key, capo, tempo and so on).
- Recognise chord-line tokens that are not chords: rhythm symbols (`/`, `x`, `-`), barlines, repeat counts such as `(2x)`, and no-chord markers (`N.C.`).
- Parse, normalise and transpose single chords (`Chord.parse`, `transpose`, `transposeUp`, `transposeDown`, `normalize`, `useModifier`).
- Change chord notation between letter symbols, solfège, Roman numerals and Nashville numbers (needs a `{key}`).
- Handle a capo: leave chords as written, or convert to sounding chords (`decapo`).
- Serialise a `Song` to a plain JavaScript object and back (`ChordSheetSerializer`).
- Basic CSS for the HTML formatters.
- Beta: PDF output (needs `jspdf`, optional) and measured HTML with precise chord positions.

### Formats supported

Read (input):

- ChordPro, including directives
- Chords over words (plain chord sheets)
- Ultimate Guitar style chord sheets (section headers such as `[Chorus]`)

Write (output):

- Plain text
- HTML, table layout
- HTML, div layout
- ChordPro
- Chords over words
- Measured HTML (beta)
- PDF (beta, optional `jspdf`)

Chord notations:

- Letter symbols (`C`, `Dm`)
- Solfège (`Do`, `Rem`)
- Roman numerals (`I`, `ii`)
- Nashville numbers (`1`, `2m`)

Not read by ChordSheetJS: saved web pages (.html), Word files, PDFs, images, and plain lyrics with no chords. Those would be our own code or are out of scope.
